# RecipeApp Frontend

## Overview
The RecipeApp frontend is a simple web application that allows users to manage their personal recipe collection and create meal plans. It communicates with the backend API to handle user authentication, recipe management, and meal planning functionalities.

## Project Structure
```

├── public/
│   └── index.html        # Main HTML file for the frontend application
├── css/
│   └── styles.css        # CSS styles for the frontend application
├── js/
│   └── app.js            # JavaScript code for handling user interactions and API requests
└── README.md             # Documentation for the frontend application
